Vitali, 
Nice job! However, since you didn’t use Neon, I wasn’t able to test your project locally. 
From what I could see in your code and presentation, your work is clean and well-structured. I like the idea of your app and the end result—it’s easy to use and clearly conveys its purpose
I would recommend adding comments to make your code clearer and easier to understand. 
Keep up the good work!
